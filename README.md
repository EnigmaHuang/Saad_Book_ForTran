# Some "ForTran" for Saad's Book

Some "Formula Translations" for Yousef Saad's book "Iterative Methods for Sparse Linear Systems (2nd Edition)". All codes are written in MATLAB and followed the algorithms given in Saad's book or the listed references. The codes are for my learning and practice, only checked for a few test cases.



## Index for the Algorithms

Chapter 6 & 7: Krylov Subspace Methods, in [this repo](https://github.com/EnigmaHuang/Krylov_Subspace_Methods)

*   (Restarted) Full Orthogonalization Method (FOM);
*   (Restarted) GMRES (with Arnold / Householder orthonormalization);
*   Conjugate Gradient (CG);
*   Conjugate Residual (CR);
*   Biconjugate Gradient without/with Stabilized (BiCG / BiCGStab).



Chapter 9: Preconditioned Iterations, in [this repo](https://github.com/EnigmaHuang/Krylov_Subspace_Methods)

*   Left preconditioned restarted GMRES;
*   Left preconditioned Conjugate Gradient.



Chapter 10: Preconditioning Techniques (in directory `Chapter10`)

*   Incomplete LU factorization with zero fill-in (ILU(0), using CSR format matrix as input and output)



Chapter 11: Multigrid Methods

*   Geometric Multigrid, in [this repo](https://github.com/EnigmaHuang/Poisson_FDM_Multigrid);
*   Classic Algebraic Multigrid, in [this repo](https://github.com/EnigmaHuang/Classic_AMG_Demo).
